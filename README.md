# wwwordlist
`wwwordlist` Creates a Unique Word List of a Web Page. This application is rather naive atm. I just whipped this up because I was having Gem dependency issues with [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL)

## USAGE
```bash
python3 wwwordlist.py (URI) | tess file.txt
```
Of course `tee` is optional. Do what you wish with the output.

## TODO
Simply ignore certain tags as an option, though I noticed that JS and CSS does have some good words to use for file / folder enum.
